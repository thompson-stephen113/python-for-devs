# Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

## Task questions:
#### Q1. What data structure did you use for recipe_1 and why?

A1. I chose dictionary for recipe_1 since the format provided involved the use of keys. When needing to access or update any of the recipes' keys and their values, they would need to be in a dictionary for this to work.

#### Q2. What data structure did you use for all_recipes and why?

A2. I chose list for all_recipes, as it is only being used to store the recipe dictionaries. The dictionaries and their key-value pairs can still be accessed through their parent list, but the dictionaries themselves are not key-value pairs, so they should be stored in a list.

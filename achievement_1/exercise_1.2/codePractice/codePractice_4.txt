Assume that you’ve run the following statements:

>>> str1 = "hello, "
>>> str2 = "how are you?"
>>> str3 = str1 + str2
("hello, how are you?")

To practice what you’ve learned, without using Python’s shell, 
work out on your own what the following statements would return:

str3[3:]
(Starts at the position 3)
Returns "lo, how are you?"

str3[-3:]
(Starts at the third position from the end)
Returns "ou?"

str3[2:9:3]
(Starts at the position 2, ends before position 9, steps every 3 positions)
Returns "l,o"

str3[::-2]
(Starts at end position, steps every 2 positions in reverse order)
Returns "?o r o olh"

str3[2:8]
(Starts at position 2, ends before position 8)
Returns "llo, h"
